# UniversalStratum
Project goal is to create a flexible stratum engine that can:
* Replace yiimp built-in stratum,
* Support customizable coinbase factories through plugins,
* Work with other pool engines through plugins,
* Work as a proxy,
* Work for both autoexchange and no exchange pools,
* Be popular enough to gather a community around it
